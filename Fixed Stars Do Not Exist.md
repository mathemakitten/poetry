*Fixed Stars Do Not Exist*

*a sestina*



**I.**

[We are] ~~two~~ stars in a galaxy

Drawing closer as we orbit each other again

Bound by the laws of time and space, ever so rational

**Fixed** as long as the great universe will stand

We are the epitome of science; exhibiting the unknown

Will we be stable forever? Perhaps it will all change *tonight*

**II.**

Light-years have separated us for millennia, but **not tonight**

Against the laws of cosmic tradition, we will take a stand

We cannot fight this wish anymore, catching fire, breaking rational*(e)*

The **Milky Way** itself will become undone, a changed galaxy

As celestial chaos ensues; *they thought this would never happen again*

All eyes are on **you and I** as we drop a match on the great unknown

**III.**

The zenith will draw an ~~invisible~~ line upon our hearts tonight

And we will dance upon the horizon at altitudes unknown

The people on **Earth** will watch our trajectory, trying to (*under*)stand

The mysteries hidden in the depths of a great galaxy

Men and women of <u>science</u>, of <u>astronomy</u>, of the <u>rational</u>

Will be amazed by Nature’s dazzling show again

**IV.**

And exactly *what* is it that captivates the galaxy?

It is the meeting of two **polar opposites**, an experiment unknown

The axis of the very universe will be transposed tonight

As two hearts collide in a “*once in a million*” fireworks show again

Nature itself will fight back with evidence of the rational

But it is **too late**; our light shines brighter, we will (*with*)stand

**V.**

So, welcome to this *strange new galaxy*

Home to my heart, nothing to you [yet] but the unknown

That will soon change; scientists always try to (*under*)stand

We are both pawns in the **game of Science**, but not tonight

Right now, this moment, Logic is eclipsed by wonder again

As you make me forget the reasons why—**irrational**

**VI.**

One day the world will look back upon this and they will (*under*)stand

They will say, “**Remember** those two, the stars that *chased the day into night*

And then, in the face of danger, *laughed* at the unknown?”

And they will hope for such another brilliant show again

It is not often that one will **dare** to **challenge the rational**

But **you and I**, we are sparkling so bright that we can be seen in every galaxy

**VII.**                            

The *very Sun* is eclipsed by blinding radiance tonight, as we abandon the rational

At the **precipice** of the galaxy, a place I thought I’d never see again

*As we stand with our hands clasped* **against the** **great unknown**
