**Where You Will Find Me**

Tonight, my thoughts are in a crowded room

with strangers whom I will never meet (in this universe)

Amongst a cacophony of bright chandelier lights

and conversations the darkest shade of royal blue  

<br/>

Tonight, my thoughts are with the pretty eyes

that were locked on you from the very first day

I can read her mind from 3549 miles away

and I only wish that I were more wrong

<br/>

Tonight, my thoughts are in a different timezone

five hours away, but seeming closer to a lifetime

Sleepy heartbeats tick with the midnight clock

You promised to never make me wait

<br/>

Tonight, my thoughts are with you (of course)

spinning around in a library of like minds

enchanted, in a place an infinite order from homeâ€”

if you believe that home is where the heart is

<br/>

Tonight, my thoughts are galaxies away in the past:

eight months ago, to the time when we stood together

on the holy ground of a crowded airport coffee shop and

you kissed me good-bye for another eight months' time

<br/>

Tonight, my thoughts are with tomorrow

Perpetually at home in the hopeful airport terminal

waiting until the day that letters, missed calls and

heartbeats align in Euclidean space and infinite time
