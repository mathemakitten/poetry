*for the place that raised me*

**I. San Juan**

a seven-day adventure across Caribbean harbours 

first-class wealth colliding with souls plucked from families across the third world

a modern-day study where skin colour demarcates servants from guests 

she and I were both 21 years old and on the verge of the rest of our lives

"this is my first grown up job. I'm so far from home," she said with such pride

that I could feel my heart shatter beneath the light of her flawless smile 

<br/>

**II. San Francisco**

here, you will find a city— no, an *icon*

with a story behind every corner, where the chasms are not so wide

walk into the fog to find the glitter adjacent to unfinished projects 

and amongst unseen people who have fallen between the cracks 

it seems that the place which is always building the future

has forgotten the people which built this place from the ground up

<br/>

**III. Vancouver**

*hello ocean*; meet skyline, meet mountains 

so picturesque that it would be easy to believe that this is heaven on earth

but traverse one parallel line to the lower East to find that

these streets are run by the people who live on it; call it home

it is not so easy to sleep under the stars when it is done out of necessity 

can we be the ones to wander the chaos to find that hope still lives here?

<br/>

**IV. Amsterdam**

take a right turn down the other side of the tourist street

away from the spot where lights over the canal make magic out of midnights 

to find a reflection of home; in neon signs, dim streetlights, and a tram line

if we have finitely many midnights to spend on this earth then

I'm thankful to stand in this moment, with you, as strangers becoming friends

on the other side of an ocean, for possibly the first time and the last time in our only lives

<br/>

**V. Copenhagen**

here we are, in the happiest country in the world

(as deemed by the inner city locals and outsiders alike)

a reputation hiding untold stories, lived only by those on the perimeter

I dare you to walk the streets of multiple colours to find the imperfect truth

isn't it telling that Nørrebro is mentioned for its multiculturalism

always in the same breath as its neighbourhood violence

<br/>

**VI. Toronto**

"*home*," to those who have lived here our entire lives

and equally so for those of us who moved here to chase the wildest dreams 

from suburbs, cities and stardust, to make up a collective of the most ambitious

for all of its infinite imperfections, this is where storytellers and creators gather

to echo louder the stories of the least of these until they become history

and me? I only count myself lucky to be part of this rising glory
